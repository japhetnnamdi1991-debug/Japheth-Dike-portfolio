## 📂 Projects
- GENDER PAY ANALYSIS DASHBOARD.
- This dashboard provides an overview of workforce and pay distribution across the organization, highlighting patterns in gender representation, salary allocation, and compensation drivers.

- The organization employs 1000 staff members with an average age of 41 years and a total salary expenditure of 94m. Gender distribution is relatively balanced, with 53.2% male employees and 46.8% female employees, representing a near-equal representation across the workforce.

- When analysing salary distribution by gender, female employees account for 55.44% of the total salary, while male employees recieve 44.56%. This suggests that higher-paying roles or senior positions may be more represented among female employees in this dataset.
- Salary by seniority. The level shows a clear upward trend, with compensation increasing steadily from entry-level to senior roles. Employees at the highest seniority level account for the highest share of the total salary.

- Education also plays a significant role in salary outcome. Employees with master's and PHD qualifications earn the highest total salaries, while those with college or high school education earn comparatively less, reinforcing the value of advanced education.

- Finally, departmental analysis reveals that sales and management have the highest salaries, while operations have the lowest. This insight can help guide workforce planning and compensation review.
