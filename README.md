## 📂 Projects
- GENDER PAY ANALYSIS DASHBOARD.
- This dashboard provides an overview of workforce and pay distribution across the organization, highlighting patterns in gender representation, salary allocation, and compensation drivers.

- The organization employs 1000 staff members with an average age of 41 years and a total salary expenditure of 94m. Gender distribution is relatively balanced, with 53.2% male employees and 46.8% female employees, representing a near-equal representation across the workforce.

- When analysing salary distribution by gender, female employees account for 55.44% of the total salary, while male employees recieve 44.56%. This suggests that higher-paying roles or senior positions may be more represented among female employees in this dataset.
- Salary by seniority. The level shows a clear upward trend, with compensation increasing steadily from entry-level to senior roles. Employees at the highest seniority level account for the highest share of the total salary.

- Education also plays a significant role in salary outcome . Employees with master's and PHD qualifications earn the highest total salaries, while those with college or high school education earn comparatively less, reinforcing the value of advanced education.

- Finally, departmental analysis reveals that sales and management have the highest salaries, while operations have the lowest. This insight can help guide workforce planning and compensation review.
